## 📌 Description

The **Java File Handling Utility** is a lightweight and beginner-friendly console application built using Java that demonstrates how to **read**, **write**, and **modify** text files using core Java I/O classes. It features a simple interface that performs:

- ✅ Writing content to a `.txt` file
- 📖 Reading and displaying file content
- ✏️ Modifying specific words inside the file

This utility leverages Java's `BufferedReader` and `BufferedWriter` for efficient file access and updates, and uses `try-catch` blocks for robust error handling. It’s ideal for students, developers, and professionals who want to learn or integrate basic file manipulation logic into their projects.
